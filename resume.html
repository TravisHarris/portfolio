				<h2>PERSONAL PROJECTS</h2>

					<h3>Gave the SpaceX Website a Mobile Friendly Overhaul</h3>
					<p>Huge fan of Elon Musk and his ventures but in my search for projects to tackle I found that SpaceX doesn't have a mobile version of their website and to be honest the difference in wow factor between Tesla's website and theirs was too drastic so I closed the gap and gave them a flashy video background and fluid UI to match Tesla's.</p>
					<h3>Designed and Developed a Space Themed Homepage For a Desktop Web Browser</h3>
					<p>This project started out as any other, overly ambitious. After learning about the power of the CSS grid layout, I wanted to see how dynamic you could make it with JavaScript. The answer is if you REALLY wanted to, you could but it quickly turned into if/else soup. So it went through several iterations until I finally landed on a fixed toggle customization system to the akin of the Momentum Chrome app.</p>
